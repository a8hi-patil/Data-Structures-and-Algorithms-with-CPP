Dynamic Programming

DP is not a data structure. It is technique of problems solving.

When to Apply : 1. Overlapping Sub-problems 2. Optimal Structure

How to solve DP Problem :

    1) Top down approach : Recurssion and Memoisation
    2) Bottom Up Approach: Loop and memoisation
    3) Space optimisation: If Possible

1. Top down approach:

   - Find out which DP is required : 1D 2D 3D
   - Store ans in DP array and return when it is required.
   - If ans is already in DP array return ans do not process further.

2. Bottom Up approach:
   - Find out which DP is required : 1D 2D 3D
   - Store base case ans in DP array and return when it is required.
   - Check parameters -> Reverse it -> copy paste.
