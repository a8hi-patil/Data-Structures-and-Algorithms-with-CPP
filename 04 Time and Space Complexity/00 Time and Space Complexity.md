- What is time complexity ?
  Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run a functiom of length of input.

- Why to study Time and Space Complexity ?
  Resources are limited
  Measure of algorithm to mnake efficient programs.
  Asked by interviewer after every solution.

* What is space complexity ?
  Amount of space taken by an algorithm to run a functiom of length of input.

- Unit of represent complexity

  1. Big O -> Upper Bound
  2. Theata 0 -> Average Bound
  3. Omega -> Lower Bound

- Big O Complexities

  1. Constant Time : O(1)
  2. Linear Time : O(n)
  3. Logarithmic time : O(logN)
  4. Quadratic time : O(N\*2)
  5. Cubic time : O(N\*3)

- Least to most complexity
  O(1)
  O(logN)
  O(rootN)
  O(N)
  O(NlogN)
  O(N*2)
  O(N*3)
  O(2^N)
  O(N!)
  O(N^N)
